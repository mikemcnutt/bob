        <p class="fade">Kentucky Community College Women in Computing (KYCCWIC) is a regional ACM-W Celebration of Women in Computing. KYCCWIC connects technical women who are working/studying in Kentucky. The annual conference provides women the opportunity to learn from industry leaders while preparing them for a future career in various technical fields. The 2025 conference will focus on artificial intelligence (AI), computer security, computer programming, data analytics, technology trends, and employment.</p>
        <h2 class="aboutribbon fade">HERizon: Embarking on Careers in Technology</h2>
        <p class="fade">This year’s theme "HERizon: Embarking on Careers in Technology" was chosen for our Women in Computing Conference with the goal of empowering and inspiring women to pursue careers in the field of technology. We believe that technology is a rapidly evolving domain with immense potential, and it is crucial to encourage and support women in accessing the opportunities it offers. By selecting this theme, we aim to create a platform where women can explore various career paths within technology, gain insights from accomplished professionals, and build a strong network of like-minded individuals. The term "HERizon" symbolizes the limitless possibilities and horizons that await women in the tech industry, highlighting the importance of breaking barriers, shattering stereotypes, and embracing the diverse perspectives and talents that women bring to the field. Through the KYCCWIC conference, we aspire to foster a supportive and inclusive environment that encourages women to embark on rewarding careers in technology and make significant contributions to the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>

It is the world's largest technical conference for women in computing (over 22,000 attendees at the Sep 2019 GHC).</p>
